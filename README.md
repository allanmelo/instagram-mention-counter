> A Node.js tool to easily count the number of mentions in a Instagram post. 

> It can be very usefull to find &#34;the most voted user&#34; in your post, or maybe to find the &#34;most relevant account recommendation&#34; by your users. 

> This little web scraper was created originaly by Igor Oliveira in his youtube channel "[Programador Br - Tutoriais](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5WWNfEzz8gOzijWT9tsW8w), but I changed the code a bit to make it a little easier for beginners to use - and to go halfway to exporting the function.
